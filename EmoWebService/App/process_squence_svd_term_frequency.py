Whatever is collected is now being transported in the warehouse, with special climate conditions, from where it is going to be available for delivery. My estimates are about 6.8 kilo per square yard. ? Of course, some potato need to be left for the next year seeds but it should not be a concern since I have a vendor who will provide enough once the spring comes.',

'Happy to talk about sales items and etc. ... sale ends soon ...so hurry up.',

'Yep, I have set it up. Better do it now when they have sale. I could not believe how many things one needs once engaged. Single life was much easier if you ask me. It is always good idea to know about coupons available. I try to follow up on the rebates programs currently in place but often miss many due to lack of time. Thanks for pointing it out to me. ... Although wedding day is not yet announced, I hope to get all the important items ahead of time: I even started buying small things that usually not important until you need them.',

'Good points ... sale ends on Friday ... see if you can get registered for as many items as possible ... more you get now ... more you save ... We should start tracking these events more actively.',
